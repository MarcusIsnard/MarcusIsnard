# Hello  🤝
I am Marcus Isnard. I enjoy building mission-critical systems with an emphasis on simplicity and robustness. I am driven to solve problems using first principles. I have eight plus years of experience working in deep tech and a strong academic background in engineering. Previously, I wrote software for airplanes and spacecraft. Now, I work at the intersection of simulation and machine learning ☁️
